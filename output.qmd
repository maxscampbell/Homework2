## Task 1: Basic Vector practice

### Question 1

```{r}
# Load in pre- and post-treatment data from assignment
pre <- c(130, 128, 116, 124, 133, 134, 118, 126, 114, 127, 141, 138, 128, 140, 137, 131, 120, 128, 139, 135)
post <- c(114, 98, 113, 99, 107, 116, 113, 111, 119, 117, 101, 119, 130, 122, 106, 106, 124, 102, 117, 113)
```

### Question 2

```{r}
# Assign names to each observation in pre and post objects
subj <- paste("Subject", 1:20, sep = "_")
names(pre) <- subj
names(post) <- subj
```

### Question 3

```{r}
# Take the difference in measurements for each subject and print the results
diff_op <- pre - post
diff_op
```

### Question 4

```{r}
# Take the mean of diff_op to find the average decrease in blood pressure across the subjects
mean(diff_op)
```

### Question 5

```{r}
# Find which patients experienced a decrease in blood pressure
decrease <- which(diff_op > 0)
decrease
```

### Question 6

```{r}
# Take the subset of patients who experienced a decrease in blood pressure
diff_op_decrease <- diff_op[decrease]
```

### Question 7

```{r}
# Get the average decrease in blood pressure for the subset of patients we just derived
mean(diff_op_decrease)
```
